- [Reading] Read article [Why Facts Don't Change Our Minds](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds)
  + The Logic of False Beliefs: Factually false, but socially accurate
  + Facts dont change our minds, friendship does: It is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and hostility. Abraham Lincoln: `I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.`
  + Spectrum of Beliefs: if you are at P7, it's better to spend time to convince people in P6 or P8, the gap is too big on P1 people.
  + Clear's Law of Recurrence: The number of people who believe an idea is directly proportional to the number of times it has been repeated during the last year even if the idea is false.
  + The Intellectual Soldier: Are you willing to not win in order to keep the
    conversation going?
  + Be kind first, be right later: The word `kind` is originated from `kin`. Kind is a good method for actually changing someone's mind. Develop a friendship. Share a meal. Gift a book.
