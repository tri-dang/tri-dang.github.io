- [Algorithm] First read of [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
  + A algorithm = procedure by getting input and give out output
  + Terminologies: algorithm, data stucture, problem, instances of problem, ...
  + A algorithm running must be terminated and giving out correct outputs ontime
  + Algorithms' applications in real world and its need for engineering
  + Efficiency: computing time + space. Compare with a faster computer, a much slower computer can give faster output with a better algorithm that have smaller complexity
  + NP-complete problem and approximate algorithm approach
