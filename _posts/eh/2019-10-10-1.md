- In Rails, MP events for `Users View Page` is kind of generic, it passes `gon.page` as var in application controller, which is ```#{controller}##{action}```. So when migrating/reworking on Rails, we need to have a black list to prevent sending old/new events.
- List down all items in menu and where are they written: react, rails
- Change Q super container max width to 880px
- Add `Visit Dashboard` MP events
- Suggest Ng Ph to work with Ken to finish all FE events in CoreHR in this week
- Suggest Huong to work on LR and TS events
